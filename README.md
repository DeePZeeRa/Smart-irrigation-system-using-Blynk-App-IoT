# Smart-irrigation-system-using-Blynk-App-IoT
This project is a smart irrigation system designed to automate and optimize plant watering using the Blynk IoT platform and Arduino. It monitors soil moisture levels and controls a water pump accordingly, enabling real-time control and monitoring via the Blynk mobile app.

🔧 Features
-Soil moisture sensing using analog sensor

-Automatic water pump activation when soil is dry

-Real-time monitoring and control via Blynk app

-Manual pump control from the app

-Power-efficient and scalable for small gardens

🛠️ Tech Stack
-Arduino UNO

-Soil moisture sensor

-Relay module and water pump

-Blynk IoT platform

-Wi-Fi module (ESP8266 or similar)

📱 How It Works
-Soil moisture is measured continuously.

-If the moisture drops below a set threshold, the pump is activated.

-Data is sent to the Blynk app for live monitoring.

-Users can also manually control the pump from their phone.
